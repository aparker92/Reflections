This week was challenging for me. I missed class on Tuesday due to illness, so I was very behind come Thursday. I found it challenging to understand the specific roles of each group member because of this. I also had challenges contacting my group since I was not in class. Once I got in touch with my horizontal group, they were the best resource in understanding the homework and my role in the group - things I missed from Tuesday. 
Ithought that the lecture on Thursday was very interesting. I liked that it showed how what we were doing still pertained to statistics (as this is a Statistics class.) I am still having issues with my computer, since I am using my old laptop, I do not have Vagrant or Virtual Box running. I will go to office hours, but I am worried that I will not get it fixed in time to finish my part of the group assignment before I need to pass it to the next person. Overall this week was difficult because I missed class. I should have started on Wednesday to try to catch up instead of waiting until Thursday.
