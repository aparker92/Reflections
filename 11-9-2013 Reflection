This week has been very productive to me. I met up with Aaron at office hours on Monday, and though it was frustrating to be yelled at for something I did not feel I had any control over and that I had done my best to prevent, it helped motivate my group so that we are now more attune to each other and to the class as a whole. Office hours are always the best ways of getting back on track I feel as the goals are much more clearly explained in small groups.
I had an a-ha moment during Thursdays class when the analyzers discussed the roles of each group and my group we assigned the role of creating a function to evaluate the error. My realization was of the magnitude of this small problem - as we have to balance all of the different variables. I feel like class has been more productive this week as we are given more time with our groups and with Aaron in smaller settings.
