The lectures this week have been very interesting. I've enjoyed looking at how people have used statistics to analyze different problems. I am looking forward to putting everything together - the scientific examples from this week and the computing that we have been doing for the past few weeks. Learning about earthquake data also made excited for our final project - incorporating the themes of this class into a real life situation
Because this week was very lecture-heavy and had little instruction and learning of new material, there is not that much to say in a reflection. If I could have done something different this week, I would have taken more notes - especially concerning the rats because it would be useful as a template for later experiments.
