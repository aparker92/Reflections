This week, installing Vagrant was challenging to me. I did not really feel like it was explained where you were typing things (like in the command prompt - Chris told me to open it and I didn't know how to). I've looked up how to do that while I was at home though.  I wish there were written instructions for what we did on Tuesday, because I'm a read/write type of learner and that's how I learn best. The people at my table are very helpful because we all seem to understand different parts and we just put it all together as a group. I also have a friend outside of class that uses github regurarly so I have been asking him for help with the lingo and how to use github.
I really enjoyed Thursdays class. I felt like it helped show the role of a Operational Manager in the group (though I made some mistakes) as well as giving feedback of what we expect of you and what you expect of us. I wish that we were learning more concrete things, rather than just installing things, and going slower over parts where we are actually doing commands, though I acknowledge that this will change once we do have things installed and are used to installing virtual box). 
Overall, I enjoyed this week, feeling that while things aren't geting easier, the mistakes and errors are getting more familiar and less scary. I will try to learn more about github and virtual box on my own before the next class and I am looking forward to next week!
