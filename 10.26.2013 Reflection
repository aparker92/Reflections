This week was frustrating for me. Though I got my computer caught up by going to office hours, I missed both days of class because of a doctors appointment and then a migraine. I am working on getting these health problems fixed, but it is frustrating to be missing class when so much is happening. I was also frustrated that though I now have a functional computer, I did not know what was going on in class. Though I asked my group this, they did not really respond. I went to Seattle this weekend and missed my group meeting where I would have been able to catch up. Though they sent me the notes of the meeting, I did not really know what was going on. It is hard to ask for help individually because the group is so big and I can't expect them to accomadate my schedule. 
I think it would be beneficial to be in smaller groups. Since we have so much work outside of class and it is basically impossible to get everyone together at the same time, I think that people (like me) get left behind. I was happier with my four person group just because we could help each other out more and find time where we could all get together to work on the assignments. 
I am planning on going to office hours on both Tuesday and Thursday to help me catch up with the rest of the class and I am working with my doctor to help get rid of my migraines as well as my other sicknesses so this will (hopefully) cease to be a problem soon.
