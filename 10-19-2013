I missed Thursday's class because I had a migraine - though I went to office hours. I found Tuesday's class very engaging but I thought that it was frustrating because we did not actually do any coding. HTML 5 kept being shown with the promise that we will know it and it is easy but nothing was actually taught to us. I thought it would be better to actually have us integrate things soon after so that we don't just forget about lecture.
I am nervous for this week's homework assignment because I still don't have Python running on my computer. I am going to office hours on Sunday so this can be fixed but I am still nervous about having everything in time. My group is capable, but I don't really have time to meet them and I hate making them carry my weight.
