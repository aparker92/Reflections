This week I came to understand more of what this class is about. Though it is frustrating that everything is very open ended, I am excited becauses it really teaches us how to tackle a large, vague problem - something very applicable to the outside world. Forming groups was challenging because even though Aaron said it could be arbitrary, there were things that needed to be accounted for, like me not being able to do anything on Saturdays, when forming a group. This was important to me because I often felt left behind because my group would be doing things and deciding things on Saturdays. I also thought it was confusing how we were supposed to break into groups - like whether we should ignore previously organized groups, like the hornizontal or vertical groups or how if we had a mix of everything we could tackle small problems in each of our areas.
Going to office hours today was helpful to help clear this up and help focus our groups, but I still feel as if I'm not quite sure how we are supposed to be splitting up problems and how much communication there will need to be between groups. Though I love that the question is open ended so that we can pursue different tracks, I wish there was more structure in the organization of it since it is difficult to organize among ourselves with no given leaders.
