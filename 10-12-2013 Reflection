This week was tough for me. I got sick, which made me miss class on Thursday. This is also the reason I am donig my reflection four days late. Tuesday was interesting, listening to all of the presentations. I have also become frustrated because of my computer. I found out that because it was a 32 bit processor I had to download different files than the rest of the class. I am feeling very behind and I am going to have to work hard to get back on track.
