This past week has been interesting. Forming my new group was difficult because I had to get in touch with my group and coordinate ourselves with the other group who were also having communication issues. Eventually I communicated with my group and Bonghyun and I met with John Risko to create SMART goals and a time line, as well as initial pseudocode. This felt good because we were making progress, even though we still hadn't heard from some group members. I missed class on Tuesday, which was disappointing because I really wanted to be there for Leun's call. I can't find notes on it, which is frustrating because I think they might really help with what my group is doing. 
I was happy with class on Thursday because it gave my group a lot of time to work and brainstorm, since we finally got in touch with the last people who hadn't responded. I am still very nervous about the classes ability to finish this assignment because it still seems like we have a lot to go.
