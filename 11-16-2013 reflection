My group changed this week. After the talk on Tuesday by Chris, my group got more clarity. I think we finally began to understand what the optimization process will look like and so what type of error function the class will need. On thursday, I was the only person from my group in class so my group merged with the other analyzer group that did the etas model. We are going to start making error diagrams and them integrating the area beneath the curve. This will prove useful to the class because it will allow us to compare error and start with the optimization process. 
I am worried about this class because I don't feel fully equipped to finish this project. It is very difficult to understand the math at a level where I can manipulate it and I have spoken to many classmates who feel the same way.  though I've taken notes on Chris explaining it 3 times. I hope my classmates office hours with professor Stark might help clear the way though.
