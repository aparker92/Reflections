This week has been challenging for me because on Monday, my computer crashed and left me without a laptop that has virtual box, or basically anything else we have been installing since the beginning of the semester. I wish there were more instructions written out so it will be easier to reinstall everything on my old laptop, and then again on my laptop when I get it back from the repair store in a few weeks.  I will go to office hours, but it seemes like a waste when I haven't had any issues with installation in the past and just need basic instructions, not specific commputer help for things that aren't working.
On Tuesday, I did not do anything during class. Though I borrowed Aaron's laptop that has linux, I did not know how to set up iPython and was told to just look off of someone else. I also figured that because it was Aaron's laptop, everything worked and I didn't need to worry about things running. I really liked Thursday's improvised lecture (though it did get repetitive.) I thought it was really useful to learn why we are using virtual box - the answer was something that had never actually occured to me. I also liked the explanation of the importance of reproducibility - it reminded me of our first lecture.
I am really excited about reproducibility. I want to do research in Psychology and especially in this field, reproduc-
ibility is a huge problem. A lot of those studies are really hard to replicate because a lot of it is observational, which annoys me a lot because it makes me question the research results. I want to have good, reliable research practices in this field, which to me includes collecting data that can be reproduced in other studies. I'm not really sure of a justification against it, other than that it is perhaps not applicable in all fields and it might limit the funding of things because it doesn't encourage new research - just more accurate research.
